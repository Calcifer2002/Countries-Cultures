		<p>Upon Jane assigning the group project, we met up with our group members in the assigned lab, read the
		specification, and figured out a topic to do that we felt was comfortable and straightforward for all of us.
		Consequently, we ended up selecting the topic "A website based on the culture of your group. Here, you can
		describe the cultures, the countries they originate from, etc.". As soon as we selected the topic, we
		decided on which country was going to be the focus of our webpage. Everybody chose one country that they
		thought was interesting to them, and this was the right decision for them. There were six choices: Malvika
		chose Brazil, Kevin chose Australia, Darragh chose Ireland, Faizan chose Pakistan, Drishti chose Nigeria,
		and Sruthi, chose Canada.<br><br>
		The first stage of the group was completed when the topic for the web page and countries were decided. The
		next step was creating the homepage and the contact page. This was done by dividing the main group into two
		subgroups with three members each. The first group included Malavika, Faizan, and Sruthi who were responsible
		for the homepage and the second group consisted of Kevin, Darragh, and Drishti working on the Contact page.
		The layout was mostly similar for both the pages so the responsibility divided between the individuals is
		the same in both groups. <br><br>For the homepage, two people were working together on the HTML and content
		while
		the third person worked with the rest of the two to create the CSS again dividing works between them such as
		one person working on the image section while the other two will be on either color palette or fonts. A
		similar structure was done while working on the contact page, but the CSS person was the same to ensure
		similarity between home and contact pages.<br><br>
		Creating the General CSS was an important part of the whole group project which was carried out by Malavika
		and Kevin. In the general CSS, Malvika concentrated on the styling tables after creating a layout keeping
		responsivity in mind while I helped her with common font style and size for headings and paragraphs and also
		the color palette. We even asked Darragh to help us with styling the iframe section in the general CSS which
		helped us work on it much faster than expected.<br><br>
		After designing the homepage, contact page, and General CSS, we all decided to work on the countries we
		decided on. Everyone had five subtopics for the countries they chose such as Introduction, history,
		traditions, music, and language. Everyone created their own HTML and CSS file for their relevant countries.
		Since this is an individual part, we didn’t want to delay our work so we decided on a deadline so we could
		move forward and check on any issues together and help each other if needed. Once, we were sure about our
		part, then we decided to have a meeting to decide what else should be done to wrap up the group project.<br><br>
		The remaining two parts of the webpage were designing the navigation bar and the footer. For the navigation
		bar, two people were in charge to work together to make it responsive, Malavika made a general design while
		Kevin helped her with Bootstrap while the footer section was done by Drishti. After all the above sections
		were completed, two people, Faizan and Kevin were responsible for assessing the webpage on how responsive it
		was. They even tried it on different devices to make sure it worked perfectly and was responsive.
