    <h1>Traditions of Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      The cuisine of Nigeria is deeply rooted in the ancient times when food<br>
      was related to art, traditions, and culture. Nigerian cuisine is known for being spicy and<br>
      ypically grain-based, and most dishes are made from starch. Nigerian cuisine comprises hundreds<br>
      of ethnic groups that comprise Nigeria. Nigerian dishes are lavish and colorful, it consists of<br>
      spices and herbs to create heavily flavored sauces. Each region in Nigeria has its own regional<br>
      favorite that is dependent on customs, tradition, and religion. The different food available also<br>
      depends on the season called the “hungry season”. A large part of Nigeria lies in the tropical part,<br>
      where fruits and vegetables are available. Some of the popular fruits are oranges, melons, grapefruits,<br>
      limes, and mangoes. People in the northern parts of Nigeria who are mainly Muslims have diets that consists<br>
      of beans, sorghum, and brown rice. The Hausa tribe eats meat in the form of tsere or suya. The Yoruba tribe,<br>
      in central Nigeria, tend to eat meat stews and mashed yams or mashed cassava. The West of the country prepares<br>
      meals using cassava flour and has specific dishes consisting of frozen fried snails, or dried shrimp.<br>
    </p>


    <p>
      Because of the lack of refrigerators in the past, the method of preparation<br>
      in Nigerian cuisine relates to salting the meat after sacrificing the animals or else the meat would go<br>
      bad. Special condiments are used to prepare Nigerian cuisine for example, black-eyed peas, ukazi leaves,<br>
      bitterleaf and chilli peppers to name a few. A lot of wooden dishes are used for preparing and serving<br>
      Nigerian cuisine. Deep serving dishes are required for the traditional Nigerian soups and for the special<br>
      fish stews. Many recipes and preparations have been passed down from one generation to another.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Nigeria is one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world due to<br>
      its rapidly growing population. The belief system of Nigeria is heavily influenced<br>
      by the colonizers. Even though colonization brought Christianity to Nigeria, there<br>
      are still places in Nigeria that practice traditional religions. While the south of<br>
      Nigeria is dominated by Christianity, the north is predominantly filled with Islam. <br>
      Which was spread due to Fulani Jihadist war campaigns of Usman Dan Fodio especially<br>
      among the Hausa tribe before the British came. Every tribe in Nigeria has its own<br>
      traditional belief system. The three major tribes are Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba. As<br>
      explained before, the Hausa people are mostly representatives of the Islam religion<br>
      they are presently the least influenced by traditional religious beliefs. During the<br>
      11th century, Islam was brought to Nigeria by traders from Guinea, Mali, and Borno to<br>
      the Hausa tribe who accepted and supported its spread. The major Hausa traditional religion<br>
      is called Maguzawa which was practiced in remote parts of Hausaland in pre-colonial Nigeria.<br>
      Maguzawa is the name for a subgroup of the Hausa people. People who practice Maguzawa<br>
      believe in three thousand spirits which are divided into two major groups. The Gona<br>
      (Farm Spirit) and the Daji (Bush spirits).<br><br>
      The six major spirits are:

    <ul>
      <li> Bagiro = the spirit that can devour souls </li>
      <li> Manzo = this spirit is described as a dog that can torture souls </li>
      <li> Babban Maza = meaning “great among men” </li>
      <li> Waziri = the spirit that provides gifts to people </li>
      <li> Mai’iali = this spirit is said to be the queen of the spirits and is portrayed by children wearing a large
        cloth </li>
      <li> Sarki Aljah = the spirit is said to be the king of all spirits </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>





    <p>
      Bori is another Hausa religion that has been practiced before colonization.<br>
      Spirit possession is the main feature, for example, they used spirits to heal illnesses by<br>
      performing exorcisms. Before colonization occurred the Igbo tribe in the South-Eastern part of<br>
      Nigeria believed in Odinani. They believed in one God (Chineke or Chukwu) who also had lots of<br>
      spirits and Odinani had a monotheistic attribute. The religion divided the world into Human and<br>
      Spirit worlds. Chineke is believed to be the creator of everything. It is taught that each person<br>
      had a guardian spirit which is called “Chi” and was given to the person by Chineke. A person’s Chi<br>
      was believed to follow them into the spirit world at death as death was believed to be a transit of<br>
      humans to the spirit world.<br>
      Chukwu was the supreme spirit but there were also lesser spirits, such as<br>

      <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li> Anyanwu = the god of the sun that controlled the weather</li>
      <li> Amadioha = the god of the sky that controlled justice and lightning</li>
      <li> Ana or Anada = the Earth goddess</li>
      <li> Ikenga = the god of time and achievement who also had control over blacksmithing and farming</li>
      <li> Ekwensu = the god of war that was mostly worshipped among warriors</li>
    </ul>
 

    <br><br>

    <p>
      The system of priests under the Odinani was divided into two types: Hereditary Priests - <br>
      were the servants of a particular god or spirit and the Seer - were the priests that were empowered with<br>
      justice functions, symbols of power, and almost limitless authority. The Igbo tribe also believed in<br>
      ancestral worship, they would communicate with their ancestors in the spirit world and made offerings<br>
      to their dead in ancestral shrines which were dedicated to ancestral worship. Finally, the Yoruba tribe<br>
      in the SouthWest part of Nigeria still practices their religion’s traditional beliefs of which the key element<br>
      is destiny “Ayanmo”. The Yoruba people believe in one Supreme God, who they call Olodumare/Eledumare, Olorun, and
      Olori.<br>
      They believe in lesser gods and spirits which have the ability to travel between Heaven and Earth. Yoruba’s also
      practice<br>
      ancestral worship by offering gifts and pouring libations to their dead.<br>
